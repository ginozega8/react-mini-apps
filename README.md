In this project, I compiled mini JS functions from when I was learning JS, this, however isn't the focus here. I made this to learn to use two common React libraries: React Router and Styling Components. React Router allowed me to present various components without the need of reloading the entire page, and just re-rendering the necesary component. Also, Styling Components allowed me to create default styles for my components.
Note: Not mobile responsive yet.
